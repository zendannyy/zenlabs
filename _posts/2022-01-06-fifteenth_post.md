One might feel like Alice in Wonderland when just starting out on their journey to learn about how to get in the field of tech.

*The rabbithole we can find ourselves in*

A lot of people are constantly trying to keep up with the new thing, the “cutting edge”. This all can be a bit overwhelming as things in technology change constantly. After being in the field of Cybersecurity for 4 years I have learned that “the only thing that is constant is change”.  


What I would recommend people do is develop a long term approach to their goals. 
This is something I have worked on recently. As I look back at every milestone I have been able to achieve, I realize this has happened only when I step back and have a longer term goal I set out. From here, milestones are reached that serve as stepping stones to that longer term goal. For example, for this year you could have a 1 year plan on getting into tech as a career, from here the milestones leading up to it might be

- 1 month -   Narrow down your interests
- 3 months - Self-study or enroll in bootcamp
- 6 months - Have meaningful relationships with 10 people in the field you’re aiming
- 12 months - Internship or interviews in the pipeline
<br>

Not to get confused here, I believe the idea of ”5-year” plans are gone. Instead, focus on creating goals a couple years out or less and milestones from within these goals. For example, work on creating a 6 month plan, then a 1 year plan. Be flexible on the timeline should your circumstances change, but be tough on yourself. 
Brutally prioritizing, is how you can look at it.

If you’re attempting to pivot into Cybersecurity as your career path, here’s another post that can help you in your journey
