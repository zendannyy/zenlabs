title: Cybsersecurity Resources for the Community
---

I put together some resources on Cybersecurity.

Searching the phrase awesome “literally any security domain”  will give you github compilations of resources for that topic.
For example awesome “pentesting”  or awesome “blue team”  or awesome "macos security" 
Even if you don’t include github in your search it should be the top result in google.

### Command Line Kung Fu
[CommandLineKungFu](http://blog.commandlinekungfu.com/)

A blog I have recommended. It goes over specific problems and solving them from the command line. It 
focuses on the “how”.

### Coursera
[Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/promo/9pKuaUa9daFdNgMEs6HtJKzoQ?utm_campaign=Refer-a-friend+Landing+Page+-+Adding+WhatsApp&utm_content=personal_url&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=Friendbuy&fbuy_ref_code=qOmaA/)

A MOOC (massive open online course). It has plenty of options for Information Security and courses are free when you audit them. This gives you the same access as paying, just no certificate when you complete it.

### Cyberdefenders
[Cyberdefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/)

This is one I recently discovered. It is a CTF platform (Capture the Flag) with various challenges in security topics and sets of questions to go through.

### Overthewire
[Overthewire](https://overthewire.org//)


Another CTF based platform. This one has various options as well, I recommend starting with Bandit, it will start teaching you the basics and progressively get more difficult. If you’re starting from scratch, start here before going to Cyberdefenders.

I hope these resources help in learning more about the field and getting started!
